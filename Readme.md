# Path visualization
## Using Depth-first Search, Breadth-first Search, Bidirectional search algorithm, A star path finding algorithm


Using pygame, the path visualization program will find a path from the start node to an end node.
You can choose a start node and an end node by yourself! You can also add blocks but deleting is not possible!
Needs pygame module to work!!





WORK IN PROGRESS!!
